- Static descriptions of planned features
- Non-functional demo buttons

### **After**:
- Four fully functional data structure modules
- Complete interactive visualizations
- Rich educational content with animations
- Professional export and analysis capabilities
- Seamless integration maintaining existing workflow

## üí° **Implementation Highlights**

1. **Preserved Architecture**: Maintained existing `DashboardFrame` structure
2. **Enhanced Functionality**: Upgraded from placeholders to full implementations
3. **Educational Focus**: Rich explanations and step-by-step guidance
4. **Professional Quality**: Export features, analysis reports, and polished UI
5. **Extensible Design**: Easy to add more modules following the same pattern

## üèÜ **Result**
The Dashboard Frame now provides a comprehensive, interactive learning environment for data structures with:
- 4 fully functional modules (BST, Graph, Hash Table, Binary Heap)
- Professional-grade visualizations and animations
- Educational explanations and analysis tools
- Export capabilities for academic use
- Consistent, high-quality user experience

The transformation from placeholder content to fully functional educational modules has been completed successfully while maintaining all existing workflows and enhancing the overall learning experience.
