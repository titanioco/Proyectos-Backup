## 🚀 Next Steps (What YOU Need to Do)

### Step 1: Get Your API Credentials

#### For OpenAI (ChatGPT PRO)
1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Log in with your ChatGPT PRO account
3. Create API key (Settings → API Keys → Create new)
4. Add billing information ($20-50 to start)
5. Copy the key (format: `sk-...`)

#### For GitHub Models (Copilot PRO)  
1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Create "Fine-grained personal access token"
3. Select your repository scope
4. Grant "Models" permission
5. Copy token (format: `github_pat_...`)

### Step 2: Configure the System

1. **Copy template to active config:**
   ```bash
   copy ai.properties.template ai.properties
   ```

2. **Edit ai.properties with your credentials:**
   ```properties
   # Enable services
   ai.openai.enabled=true
   ai.github.enabled=true
   
   # Add your actual keys
   openai.api.key=sk-your-actual-openai-key-here
   github.api.token=github_pat_your-actual-token-here
   ```

### Step 3: Test the Integration

1. **Verify configuration:**
   ```bash
   cd src/com/raven/config
   java AIVerifier
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   ant clean compile run
   ```

3. **Test AI chat:**
   - Look for new AI chat interface in your app
   - Send test message: "Help me with my research methodology"
   - Verify AI response
